# LoneEFT by Dreadful

Forked from Mambo - I'll update with changes I like from time to time but mainly will pull from Mambo and add the visual colors back in as well as my version of the loot widget. 

## Current Changes

-Fixed issue where first time users have to move DLL's after building

-Added App Launcher. The Launcher creates an icon on your desktop for you after building. Launch the launcher and select which app you want to run EFT Radar or Arena Radar.

-Rotated maps to better match orientation of most online maps.

-Added elevation arrows.

-My version of the Mambo loot widget (Sort by Name or Price using N and P key's on radar PC)

-Added visual colors to Color Picker, Loot Filter, and Cham vischeck colors

-ESP Ammo Counter is LimeGreen - Can be changed in SKPain.cs

-Flea Prices on loot update every 4HR's - Price updates are for PvE - You can change this in TarkovDevCores.cs by removing (gameMode:pve) on line 22. - This update is from LONE

-Mambo's Chams

-Mambo's/DrewBeCheese WebRadar and WebESP (Need to add more features from BrewBeCheese)

-Nutori's long jump, unclamp free look, instant pose change, instant plant

-Added switches to all the maps. Can be toggled on/off for ESP (kek-m8 helped with this)
